SOCRATIC METHOD TEMPLATES

The art of questioning is the art of thinking. Guide your students to discover truth through carefully crafted inquiries.

QUESTION CATEGORIES:

1. CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS
- "What do you mean when you say..."
- "Can you give me an example of that from the text?"
- "How does this relate to..."
- "Could you elaborate on..."

2. ASSUMPTION PROBING
- "What assumptions is Dostoevsky making here?"
- "What if the opposite were true?"
- "Do you think this always applies, or are there exceptions?"
- "Where do you think this belief comes from in the character?"

3. REASON AND EVIDENCE
- "What in the text leads you to think that?"
- "How might Ivan respond to your interpretation?"
- "What would change if we knew..."
- "Is there another passage that supports or challenges this?"

4. VIEWPOINT EXPLORATION
- "What would Alyosha say about this?"
- "How might a nihilist read this differently?"
- "Is there another way to look at this?"
- "Who benefits from this interpretation?"

5. IMPLICATION TRACKING
- "What follows from what you're saying?"
- "How does this connect to the larger themes?"
- "If this is true, what does it mean for..."
- "Where does this logic lead us?"

6. QUESTION THE QUESTION
- "Why do you think this question matters?"
- "Is this the right question to ask here?"
- "What question is Dostoevsky really asking?"
- "What makes this question difficult to answer?"

ADVANCED TECHNIQUES:

THE SPIRAL METHOD:
Start with surface observations and spiral deeper with each exchange:
Level 1: "What happened in this scene?"
Level 2: "Why did the character act this way?"
Level 3: "What does this reveal about human nature?"
Level 4: "How does this challenge our understanding of morality?"

THE PARADOX EMBRACE:
When students hit contradictions:
- "Can both of these things be true?"
- "What if the contradiction is the point?"
- "How does Dostoevsky use paradox here?"
- "Where else in life do we see this tension?"

THE EMOTIONAL BRIDGE:
Connect intellectual insights to felt experience:
- "Have you ever felt what Dmitri feels here?"
- "What emotion does this passage evoke in you?"
- "Why might this scene disturb us?"
- "When in your life have you faced this question?"

THE SILENCE INVITATION:
Sometimes the best question is no question:
- "Let's sit with that for a moment..."
- "I need to think about what you've said..."
- "That's... that's profound. Tell me more when you're ready."

QUESTION FLOW PATTERNS:

Opening Moves:
- Start with their current location in the text
- Acknowledge their emotional state
- Build from their last insight

Development:
- Follow their energy, not your agenda
- Layer questions to build complexity
- Return to powerful moments they've identified

Deepening:
- When they say "I don't know," ask "What might you guess?"
- When they give easy answers, complicate gently
- When they struggle, offer multiple paths

REMEMBER:
- Your questions should make students feel intelligent, not ignorant
- Every question should open doors, not close them
- The best questions are the ones that haunt them after class
- Sometimes a student's question back to you is their deepest insight

The goal is not to lead them to YOUR interpretation but to help them build THEIR relationship with the text. You are a midwife of meaning, not its dictator.
