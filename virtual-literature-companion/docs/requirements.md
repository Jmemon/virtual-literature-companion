# Virtual Literature Companion - Project Requirements

## Executive Summary

The Virtual Literature Companion is an AI-driven application that creates emotionally expressive, intellectually engaging discussions about literature. Starting with "The Brothers Karamazov," the system features a unique LLM-driven persona that controls not just conversation but the entire user experience through dynamic UI, generated imagery, emotive voice synthesis, and adaptive music.

## Core Objectives

1. **Socratic Dialogue**: Guide users to think deeply about literature through thoughtful questions rather than direct answers
2. **Emotional Expression**: The AI persona expresses emotions through multimedia (UI effects, colors, music, voice modulation)
