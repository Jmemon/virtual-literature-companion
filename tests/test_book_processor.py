The Brothers Karamazov
by Fyodor Dostoevsky

PART I

Chapter 1: Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov

Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, 
a land owner well known in our district in his own day, and still remembered among 
us owing to his gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and 
which I shall describe in its proper place.

This opening introduces us to the Karamazov family and sets the stage for the 
dramatic events that will unfold. The father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, is a character 
of particular interest - a sensualist and buffoon who nonetheless possesses a 
certain cunning intelligence.

Chapter 2: He Gets Rid of His Eldest Son

You must know that Fyodor Pavlovitch was twice married, and had three sons, the 
eldest Dmitri, by his first wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. 
Fyodor Pavlovitch's first wife, AdelaÃ¯da Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich 
and distinguished noble family.

The abandonment of young Dmitri reveals much about Fyodor Pavlovitch's character.
He is a man who shirks responsibility and pursues his own pleasures without 
regard for others, even his own children.

Chapter 3: The Second Marriage and the Second Family

Very shortly after getting his four-year-old Mitya off his hands Fyodor 
Pavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage lasted eight years. He 
took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young girl, from another 
province, where he had gone upon some small piece of business.
